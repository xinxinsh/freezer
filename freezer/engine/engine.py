    """
    The main part of making a backup and making a restore is the mechanism of
    implementing it. For a long time Freezer had only one mechanism of
    doing it - invoking gnutar and it was heavy hard-coded.

    Currently we are going to support many different approaches.
    One of them is rsync. Having many different implementations requires to
    have an abstraction level

    This class is an abstraction over all implementations.

    Workflow:
    1) invoke backup
        1.1) try to download metadata for incremental
        1.2) create a dataflow between backup_stream and storage.write_backup
            Backup_stream is producer of data, for tar backup
            it creates a gnutar subprocess and start to read data from stdout
            Storage write_backup is consumer of data, it creates a thread
            that store data in storage.
            Both streams communicate in non-blocking mode
        1.3) invoke post_backup - now it uploads metadata file
    2) restore backup
        2.1) define all incremental backups
        2.2) for each incremental backup create a dataflow between
            storage.read_backup and restore_stream
            Read_backup is data producer, it reads data chunk by chunk from
            the specified storage and pushes the chunks into a queue.
            Restore stream is a consumer, that is actually does restore (for
            tar it is a thread that creates gnutar subprocess and feeds chunks
            to stdin of this thread.
